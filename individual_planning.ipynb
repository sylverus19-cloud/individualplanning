    "1) Description\n",

    "I analyse two tables from a UBC Minecraft research server: players.csv (196 observations, 7 variables) contains one row per participant, while sessions.csv (1,535 observations, 5 variables) contains one row per gameplay session. players.csv records who each player is and whether they opted into the newsletter; sessions.csv records when each session started and ended. At a glance, a few practical issues are worth noting: some time stamps may not parse cleanly; a number of players appear in players.csv but never show up in the sessions table; some fields can be missing or inconsistently filled; time zones and daylight-saving changes could shift the recorded times; and because participation is voluntary, the data may not represent all players equally. The data were gathered in two parts: a sign-up form (player info and newsletter opt-in) and server logs (session start/end times), joined by the hashed email. We summarize the full dataset here even if we later use only a subset of variables for modeling.\n"
